## **Purpose of the Code**  
This project is a straightforward implementation of Stack and Queue data structures using Linked Lists. It has been developed as part of an academic assignment.  

---

## **Features**  

### **Stack Implementation:**  
- Push operation  
- Pop operation  
- Peek operation  
- Check if the stack is empty  

### **Queue Implementation:**  
- Enqueue operation  
- Dequeue operation  
- Peek operation  
- Check if the queue is empty  

---

## **Stack Documentation**  

### **Overview**  
A stack operates on the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, where elements are added to and removed from the top.  

### **Methods**  
- **`push(value)`**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
- **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the top element. Returns "Stack is empty" if the stack is empty.  
- **`peek()`**: Returns the top element without removing it. Returns "Stack is empty" if the stack is empty.  
- **`isEmpty()`**: Checks if the stack is empty.  
- **`stackSize()`**: Returns the current size of the stack.  
- **`displayStack()`**: Displays all elements in the stack from top to bottom.

## **Queue Documentation**  

### **Overview**  
A queue operates on the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle, where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.  

### **Methods**  
- **`enqueue(element)`**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.  
- **`dequeue()`**: Removes and returns the element from the front. Returns "Queue is empty" if the queue is empty.  
- **`peek()`**: Returns the front element without removing it. Returns "Queue is empty" if the queue is empty.  
- **`isEmpty()`**: Checks if the queue is empty.  
- **`size()`**: Returns the current size of the queue.  
- **`displayQueue()`**: Displays all elements in the queue from front to rear.

## **Time Complexity**  

### **Stack**  
- **Push:** O(1)  
- **Pop:** O(1)  
- **Peek:** O(1)  

### **Queue**  
- **Enqueue:** O(1)  
- **Dequeue:** O(1)  
- **Peek:** O(1)
